I started this book right after finishing my Tech Art Aid [video series about profiling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9Yb8Y2-Kng&list=PLF8ktr3i-U4A7vuQ6TXPr3f-bhmy6xM3S). I intend it to be a complete, in-depth guide to graphics optimization in Unreal Engine projects. At the same time, I'd like it be easy to read and relevant to your practical experience.

The book is a work-in-progress. Please send any ideas, mistakes encountered and feedback to Twitter [@TechArtAid](https://twitter.com/techartaid) or oskar{at}oskarswierad.com.

Good luck with your projects,

Oskar Åšwierad
