# Unreal Art Optimization

I&nbsp;started this book right after finishing my Tech&nbsp;Art&nbsp;Aid [video series about profiling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9Yb8Y2-Kng&list=PLF8ktr3i-U4A7vuQ6TXPr3f-bhmy6xM3S). I&nbsp;want to make it a complete, in-depth guide to graphics optimization in Unreal Engine projects. At the same time, I'd like it be easy to read and relevant to your practical&nbsp;experience.

The book is a work-in-progress. I'd be grateful for any ideas, mistakes encountered and feedback you send to oskar{at}oskarswierad.com.
