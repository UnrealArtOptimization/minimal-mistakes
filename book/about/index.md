I started this book right after finishing my Tech Art Aid [{{ icon_link }} video series about profiling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9Yb8Y2-Kng&list=PLF8ktr3i-U4A7vuQ6TXPr3f-bhmy6xM3S). I intend it to be a complete, in-depth guide to graphics optimization in Unreal Engine projects. At the same time, I'd like it be easy to read and relevant to your practical experience.

The book is a work-in-progress. I'd be grateful for any ideas, mistakes encountered and feedback you send to [<i class="fa fa-twitter" aria-hidden="true" title="Twitter"></i> @TechArtAid](https://twitter.com/techartaid) or to oskar<i class="fa fa-at" aria-hidden="true"></i><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,0); font-size: 0;"> at </span>oskarswierad.com

The license for using and modifying the book can be found in the [License page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link book/about/license.md %}).

Good luck with your creative endeavors,

Oskar Åšwierad
