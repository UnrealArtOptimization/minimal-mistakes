## General

* Specific examples with diagnosis and fixes. Ie high draw calls. Heavy foliage, problematic lighting / shadows.
* Comparison between different textures size (polycount, etc.) and their impact on performance

* Unbound changed name to Infinite Extent (Unbound)

##Measuring Performance

* Add an example or 2. Maybe mention the hardware that the tests were captured on.
* I feel like you could inject something in , like a sentence as a bridge between the parts below cause from a reader's perspective, I was going to see a quick explanation of why ms is important but then realised you actually have a few paragraphs to explain "why FPS cannot be used" 
* http://prntscr.com/golfik I love this part and would love it even more if we can see what were cut off to reduce translucency from 15ms to 3ms 
* I like all the explaination about UE profiling tools. I think would even better if you can give an example of optimisation workflow, of what you would do / like what commands you will start first & suggestions etc So people like me can see what a pro normally do and start follow his path. Like, I would imagine what I would do is to start with Stat Unit , then move to Stat GPU
